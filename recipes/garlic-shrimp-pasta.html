            <li>1 (10 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 large tomatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Romano cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </p>
        
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, 
            stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. 
            Drain and set aside until needed. </p>

        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>While the pasta is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon butter and oil in a large 
            oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 
            about 30 seconds. Add shrimp, 2 tablespoons parsley, and dill; cook until 
            shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 1 1/2 to 
            2 minutes per side. Transfer shrimp to a plate, leaving any cooking juices 
            in the pan. </p>

        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the skillet over medium heat. Whisk 
            in flour until fully combined and starting to turn golden, 30 seconds to 
            1 minute. Whisk in chicken broth until combined, then repeat with milk. 
            Stir in tomatoes, lemon juice, salt, and pepper; bring to a simmer. </p>

        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p> Add 1/2 cup Parmesan and Romano; stir until cheeses begin to melt and sauce 
            is creamy. Add 1 tablespoon mozzarella cheese, then mix in 1/2 of the cooked 
            pasta. Add more pasta if there is enough sauce to coat it. Stir in shrimp, 
            then top with remaining mozzarella, Parmesan, and parsley.</p>

        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p> Bake in the preheated oven until golden on top and bubbling around the edges, 
            8 to 10 minutes. </p>
        
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p> If the top of the dish is not a nice golden color after baking, you can broil 
            it, watching closely, for 2 to 3 minutes. </p>
